# VITA Model HLS Implementation on VCK190

## Introduction

This repository contains the High-Level Synthesis (HLS) implementation for the VITA model, which accelerates Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Human Mesh Recovery tasks through hardware-algorithm co-design. The following steps and resources will guide you through setting up your environment, running Vitis AI models, and converting models using Vitis AI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure that you have set up your environment according to the following steps:

1. **Review Vitis AI Quickstart Guide**:
   - Please go through the Vitis AI Quickstart guide for VCK190:
   - [Vitis AI Quickstart for VCK190](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/3.0/html/docs/quickstart/vck190.html)

2. **Download Prebuilt Image**:
   - Use this prebuilt image to run Vitis AI models on the VCK190:
